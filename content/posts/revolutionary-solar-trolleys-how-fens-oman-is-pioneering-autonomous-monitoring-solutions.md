Visionary Approach to Security

At Fens Oman, we recognized the market need for autonomous surveillance systems long before it became mainstream. Founded in 2001 as an ELV systems provider, including security and CCTV systems, we naturally evolved into innovative solution developers.

Our Solar Trolleys were born from understanding unique challenges of the Omani market: the need to ensure reliable monitoring in remote locations without grid access, while guaranteeing 100% autonomous operation in desert climate conditions.

Technical Excellence of Our Solution

The Solar Trolley shown integrates high-efficiency solar panels with advanced surveillance cameras on a telescopic mast, providing:

Energy Autonomy: Modern solar panels with up to 23.5% efficiency guarantee continuous operation even in limited sunlight. Our battery system ensures up to 10 days of operation without recharging.

360-Degree Coverage: Telescopic masts up to 7 meters high elevate cameras to optimal height for maximum surveillance radius.

Real-World Applications

**Our Solar Trolleys have already proven effective across diverse application scenarios:**

	•	Construction Sites: Securing expensive equipment and materials

	•	Oil & Gas Facilities: Monitoring critical infrastructure in remote areas

	•	Mass Events: Temporary security systems for festivals and conferences

	•	Border Control: Autonomous monitoring of extended border sections

The Future of Mobile Monitoring

We continue developing the technology, integrating 5G connectivity, thermal cameras, and environmental monitoring systems. Our goal is to create the most advanced autonomous monitoring ecosystem in the Middle East.

At Fens Oman, we don’t just follow trends – we create them. Our Solar Trolleys prove that Omani companies can develop world-class technologies combining innovation, sustainability, and practicality. This is our contribution to a future where security and environmental responsibility go hand in hand.
